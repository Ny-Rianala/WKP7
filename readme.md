### Structure
-  Firstly, I created an object of array for the list and variables.
-  Secondly, I created a function to grab all of the list inside of the object.
-  Thirdly, there is a new function that will show the form.
- Finally, there is a function that will handle the submit button and there is an eventlistener that listen for a submit.  
### Time
-  If I have more time I would solve the problem in the event listener first because, it gave me an error that it could not read the property of null. Also, I will make sure that evrything is in the correct place such as the css, cleaning the code.  
### Challenging parts  
-  For me, I do not really know how can we have the value from. I only remember litle thing but I think they are not correct because it did not work.
### What I need more explanation
I think I need more explanation in the input form and its relation with the submit. 
### Comments
I am sorry because I did not see the message that we don't need the list anymore and I still added it there.
